- run build again to get to wheel.
- do templates.
- get ridd of click and use pytconf instead.
- make 'pull' do stuff in parallel.
	This would be much faster when I have lots of repos.
- make 'clean' be based on gitpython and not command line.
- do grep functionality.
- enable to be terse and only show names of repos to enable scripting.
